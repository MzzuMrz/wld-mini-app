# World ID Voting App

Welcome! 🎉

This repository provides a secure voting application built with [World's Mini Apps](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps) technology. The app uses World ID verification to ensure only eligible users can create polls and vote.

The application is built with **Next.js** and showcases various [commands](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps/quick-start/commands) supported by the MiniKit SDK, focused on creating a user-friendly and secure voting experience.

## 🚀 Latest Updates

We've fixed several issues in the voting application:

1. **Login Flow Fixed**: The login now correctly updates the shared context, ensuring the main menu appears immediately after authentication
2. **Dropdown Menus Working**: All select inputs in the Create Poll page now work correctly with proper handling
3. **Infinite Loop Bug Fixed**: Resolved render loop issues by memoizing functions and properly managing state
4. **Mock Data Added**: Test polls are now available to demonstrate functionality
5. **UI/UX Enhanced**: Improved mobile-friendly design with better feedback and animations

Let's dive in!

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MzzuMrz/wld-mini-app.git
cd wld-mini-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure your environment variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the required variables:

#### 🔑 APP_ID

Find your **App ID** in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/) (`Configuration > Basic`).

#### 🔑 DEV_PORTAL_API_KEY

Generate your **API Key** under the `API Keys` section.  
**Note:** Visible only once—copy it carefully!

#### 🔑 JWT_SECRET

Add a strong, random string as your JWT secret for secure user sessions:

JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_at_least_32_chars_long

This secret is used to:
- Sign and verify JWT tokens for user authentication
- Maintain persistent login sessions across page refreshes
- Securely store user information between visits

**Security Tips:**
- Use a cryptographically strong random string (at least 32 characters)
- Never expose this secret in client-side code
- Consider rotating this secret periodically for enhanced security

Without a properly configured `JWT_SECRET`, the authentication system will not work correctly, and users will need to log in each time they visit your Mini App.

## ▶️ Running the Project

Run your voting app locally:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 📱 Testing on Mobile

To test your voting app directly on your phone, expose your app publicly using NGROK.

### 🚀 Using NGROK

Install [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) and run:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:3000
```

NGROK provides a publicly accessible URL.

### 🌎 Configuring Your App (Developer Portal)

Go to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/) and configure:

- **App URL:** Set it to your NGROK-generated URL.

### 📱 Opening your Voting App in World App

From the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/), navigate to `Configuration > Basic` and scan the generated QR code.

The World App will automatically launch your voting app! 🎉

## 🧠 Implementation Details

This voting app demonstrates several key features:

1. **Context API**: Uses React Context to share state across components
2. **Mock Data Storage**: Implements in-memory storage for polls and votes (could be replaced with a real backend later)
3. **Verification Levels**: Respects the World ID verification levels for access control
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layout that works well on all devices
5. **Tailwind CSS**: Styling using utility-first approach for maintainable code

The implementation currently uses in-memory storage as a backend mock. To create a production-ready version, you would need to:

1. Replace the mock storage with an actual database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Add more comprehensive testing
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines
